GitOps Workflow Project

   


---

Project Overview

This project demonstrates a fully automated GitOps workflow, illustrating the integration of version control, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and deployment best practices.
Developed as part of the Elevate Labs Internship, this project provides hands-on experience in implementing modern DevOps and GitOps practices for web applications.

The repository contains a simple Flask web application that is:

Fully containerized using Docker.

Automated for CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

Designed for rapid, repeatable deployments following GitOps principles.



---

Project Goal

The main objectives of this project were to:

1. Implement a fully automated CI/CD pipeline from code commit to deployment.


2. Build and manage Docker images for a Flask application.


3. Ensure reliable, repeatable deployment of containerized applications.


4. Gain hands-on experience with GitOps practices and workflow automation.




---

Technologies Used

Python 3.9+ – Backend development.

Flask – Web framework for the application.

Docker – Containerization of the application.

GitHub Actions – CI/CD automation and pipeline orchestration.

GitHub – Source code version control.



---

Process & Implementation

The project followed a structured workflow:

1. Repository Setup

Initialized Git repository with proper branching strategy.

Structured project folders to separate application code, Docker configuration, and CI/CD workflows.



2. Application Development

Developed a minimal Flask web application serving static content.

Added health checks and basic logging for observability.



3. Containerization with Docker

Created a Dockerfile defining the Flask application environment:

FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

Built and tested Docker images locally to ensure correct application behavior.



4. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

Configured GitHub Actions workflow to:

1. Trigger on push or pull request events.


2. Install dependencies and run unit tests.


3. Build Docker image and push to DockerHub or GitHub Container Registry.


4. Deploy application to staging/production environments (optional).





5. Testing & Verification

Verified automated pipeline by triggering multiple commits.

Ensured Docker images were correctly tagged and deployed after each commit.

Challenges & Learnings

Challenge 1: Dependency Management

Issue: Some packages failed to install in CI environment.

Solution: Pin versions in requirements.txt and add caching to GitHub Actions workflow.


Challenge 2: Docker Networking in CI

Issue: Containers could not start due to port conflicts in the GitHub Actions runner.

Solution: Dynamically assigned ports and ensured proper container cleanup after each workflow run.


Key Takeaways

Deepened understanding of CI/CD pipelines and GitOps workflow.

Learned to troubleshoot containerized applications in automated environments.

Gained practical experience with GitHub Actions, Docker best practices, and deployment automation.



---

Outcome

The final project demonstrates a fully automated GitOps pipeline that:

Ensures every commit is tested, built, and containerized.

Provides repeatable and reliable deployments.

Serves as a professional-grade reference for DevOps practices in Python applications.



---

Next Steps / Future Enhancements

Integrate Kubernetes deployment for orchestration and scaling.

Add automated rollback in case of deployment failures.

Implement advanced monitoring and alerting with Prometheus/Grafana.

If you want, I can also create a “super premium, portfolio-ready” version with visuals, badges, and a step-by-step workflow diagram, similar to what top DevOps professionals showcase on GitHub. This would make the README stand out even more.

Do you want me to do that next?
